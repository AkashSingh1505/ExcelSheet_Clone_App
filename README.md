# Excel Clone App

This Android app, built using Kotlin for the backend and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, provides users with a basic Excel sheet clone. Users can maintain data with various text sizes, colors, styles (bold, italic, underline), and alignments. The app also includes functionalities such as cut, copy, and paste. Additionally, users can save the data, which returns a JSON format of the data to the developer.

Basic Editing Functions: Includes standard editing functions such as cut, copy, and paste to manage data efficiently.
Data Saving: Enables users to save their data, providing a JSON format of the data to the developer for further processing.
